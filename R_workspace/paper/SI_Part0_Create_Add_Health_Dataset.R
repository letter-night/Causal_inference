## STEPS TO OBTAIN ADD HEALTH PUBLIC USE DATA
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# As explained on the Add Health website (https://addhealth.cpc.unc.edu/data/),
# the public-use datasets are distributed free of charge by three sources, inter alia,
# by the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR).

# The files are available for download from the ICPSR website:
# https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/21600?archive=ICPSR&q=21600#
# To download the data, users are required to agree to the terms of use and to 
# specify the reason for download.

# In our example, we use the in-home questionnaire data from Wave I (21600-0001-Data.rda),
# Wave II (21600-0005-Data.rda), and Wave III (21600-0008-Data.rda).

# See also the codebook explorer to search for specific items:
# https://addhealth.cpc.unc.edu/documentation/codebook-explorer/#/
